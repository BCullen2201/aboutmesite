			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>My name is Brandon Cullen. I'm from the United States, I'm 21 years old, and I started gaining an interest in programming around 2 years ago.</p>
			<p>My father was the biggest reason I really started getting into programming. He's taught me a lot of what I know, and always encourages me to learn more.</p>
			<p>I first started by learning C# back in the summer of 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown. I chose C# because I originally wanted to try to make video games using Unity, and there was a tutorial for C# made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys" target="_blank">Brackeys</a>, who were a channel mainly focused on game development using the Unity engine.</p>
			<p>I don't really aspire to make games anymore. I mostly just write code as a hobby now. It's something I'm interested in, it makes me use my brain, and I enjoy it. (Most of the time!)</p>
